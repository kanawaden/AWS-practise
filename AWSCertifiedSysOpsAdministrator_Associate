AutoScaling
- AutoScaling will throw an error when there is conflict in the schedule of 2 seperate autoscaling process. Error is thrown during configuration of the 2nd process itself and it will not allow to save 2nd process.
- As per Autoscaling, a user can schedule an action upto a month in the future.
- Autoscaling might suspend the processes for Auto Scaling groups that repeatedly fails to launch instances. This is known as an administrative suspension and most commonly applies to Auto Scaling groups that has been trying to launch instances for over 24 hours but have not succeeded in launching any instances.
- Autoscaling enables you to suspend and then resume one or more of the Autoscaling processes in ASG. This can be very useful when you want to investigate the configuration problem or other issue with your web application and then make changes into your application without triggering autoscaling process.
- The CLI command update-auto-scaling-group can be used to combine 2 groups.
- 


Load Balancer
- To ensure that a classic load balancer stops sending requests to instances that are deregistered or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connection open, use connection draining. This enables load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to the instances that are deregistered or unhealthy.
- When you enable connection draining, you can specify the maximum time for the load balancer to keep the connection live before reporting the instance as deregistered. The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 to 3600 secs(1 hour).



EC2
- AWS Tags enables you to categorise your AWS resources in different ways. As per AWS below are the restrictions on tags - 
    => Max no of tags per resource is 50.
    => Max key length is 127 unicode chars in UTF-8
    => Max value length is 255 unicode chars in UTF-8
    => Tags keys and values are case sensitive.
    => Do not use AWS: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use.  
- When you try to delete a subnet which has instances it will not allow to delete it.
- For EC2 classic, the Elastic IP is disassociated from the instance when you stop it.
- You need to ensure you are entering right user name if you get the error "Host Key not found."
- 

S3
- buckets ACL permission
  => Everyone
  => Any Authenticated AWS user
  => Log Delivery
  => Me


CloudFormation
- You can use WaitCondition for situation like following:
  => To coordinate the stack resource creation with configuration actions that are external to the stack creation.
  => To track the status of configuration process.


VPC
- Go through CIDR properly.
- 


RDS
- In a multi AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary instance is synchronously replicated across AZ to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate IO freezes and minimizes latency spikes during system backups.
  As per AWS below are the best practices for multiAZ:
  => For production workloads, we recommend you use Provisioned IOPS and DB instance classes (m1.large and larger) that are optimized for provisioned IOPS for fast consistent performance.
  => Also if backups are scheduled during working hours, then I/O can be suspended and increase the latency of the DB, hence it is better to schedule outside office hours.
-

SQS
- newly created queue structure : http://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<accountid>/<queue-name>
  for eg : http://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456123456/myqueue
- You can configure the amazon SQS message retention period to a value between 1 min to 14 days (default is 4 days). Once the message retention limit is reached, messages are automatically deleted.

Billing
- Billing reports provide information about your usage of AWS resources and estimated costs for that usage. You can have AWS generated billing reports that break down your estimated costs in different ways:
  => By the hour, day or month.
  => By each account in your organisation.
  => By product or product resource.
  => By tags that you define yourself.

CloudWatch
- You can publish your own metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API.
- Metrics are updated every five minutes and automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch for every EMR cluster. This interval is not configurable. There is no charge for the Amazon EMR metrics reported in CloudWatch. Metrics are archived for two weeks, after which the data is discarded.
