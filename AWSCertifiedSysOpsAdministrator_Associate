AutoScaling
- AutoScaling will throw an error when there is conflict in the schedule of 2 seperate autoscaling process. Error is thrown during configuration of the 2nd process itself and it will not allow to save 2nd process.
- As per Autoscaling, a user can schedule an action upto a month in the future.
- Autoscaling might suspend the processes for Auto Scaling groups that repeatedly fails to launch instances. This is known as an administrative suspension and most commonly applies to Auto Scaling groups that has been trying to launch instances for over 24 hours but have not succeeded in launching any instances.
- Autoscaling enables you to suspend and then resume one or more of the Autoscaling processes in ASG. This can be very useful when you want to investigate the configuration problem or other issue with your web application and then make changes into your application without triggering autoscaling process.
- The CLI command update-auto-scaling-group can be used to combine 2 groups.

Load Balancer
- To ensure that a classic load balancer stops sending requests to instances that are deregistered or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connection open, use connection draining. This enables load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to the instances that are deregistered or unhealthy.
- When you enable connection draining, you can specify the maximum time for the load balancer to keep the connection live before reporting the instance as deregistered. The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 to 3600 secs(1 hour).



EC2
- AWS Tags enables you to categorise your AWS resources in different ways. As per AWS below are the restrictions on tags - 
    => Max no of tags per resource is 50.
    => Max key length is 127 unicode chars in UTF-8
    => Max value length is 255 unicode chars in UTF-8
    => Tags keys and values are case sensitive.
    => Do not use AWS: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use.  
- When you try to delete a subnet which has instances it will not allow to delete it.
- For EC2 classic, the Elastic IP is disassociated from the instance when you stop it.
- You need to ensure you are entering right user name if you get the error "Host Key not found."
- A bastion host is a special purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. The computer generally hosts a single application, for example a proxy server, and all other services are removed or limited to reduce the threat to the computer.
  In AWS, A bastion host is kept on a public subnet. Users log on to the bastion host via SSH or RDP and then use that session to manage other hosts in the private subnets.
  You can have a bastion host running in multiple AZ, but the recommendation is to have one running in each AZ. Hence you need to make sure that the Autoscaling group is set to a maz-size of one.

S3
- buckets ACL permission
  => Everyone
  => Any Authenticated AWS user
  => Log Delivery
  => Me
- S3 Analytics (Storage Class Analysis) helps you to analyze storage access patterns and transition the right data to the right storage class. This new S3 Analytics feature automatically identifies infrequest access patterns to help you transition storage to Standard-IA.
- S3 Object Tags are keyvalue pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object. With these, you'll have the ability to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, setup S3 lifecycle policies, and customize storage metrics. These object tags can then manage transitions between storage classes and expire objects in the background.
- S3 Inventory provides a scheduled alternative to Amazon S3's synchronous List API. You can configure S3 Inventory to provide a CSV or ORC file output of your objects and their corresponding metadata on a daily basis for an S3 bucket or prefix. You can simplify and speed up business workflows and big data jobs with S3 Inventory. You can use S3 inventory to verify encryption and replication status of your objects to meet business, compliance, and regulatory needs.
- S3 Multipart upload advantages:
  => Improved throughput - you can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput.
  => Quick recovery from any network issues - smaller part size minimized the impact of restarting a failed upload due to network error.
  => Pause and resume object uploads - you can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload there is no expirey; you must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload.
  => Begin an upload before you know the final object size - you can upload an object as you are creating it.


CloudFormation
- You can use WaitCondition for situation like following:
  => To coordinate the stack resource creation with configuration actions that are external to the stack creation.
  => To track the status of configuration process.
- Elements of CloudFormation template (templates are JSON or YAML formatted text files)
  => An optional list of template parameters (input values supplied at stack creation time)
  => An optional list of output values (e.g. the complete URL to a web application)
  => An optional list of data tables used to lookup static configuration values (e.g AMI names)
  => The list of AWS resources and their conf value
  => A template file format version number

VPC
- Go through CIDR properly.
- When you design a web server and db server, the security group must be defined so that the webserver can talk to db server whereas while communicating through subnets you need to define network ACL.
- Elastic Network Interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.
- 


RDS
- In a multi AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary instance is synchronously replicated across AZ to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate IO freezes and minimizes latency spikes during system backups.
  As per AWS below are the best practices for multiAZ:
  => For production workloads, we recommend you use Provisioned IOPS and DB instance classes (m1.large and larger) that are optimized for provisioned IOPS for fast consistent performance.
  => Also if backups are scheduled during working hours, then I/O can be suspended and increase the latency of the DB, hence it is better to schedule outside office hours.
- By default AWS rotates the logs so its better to store it in database to ensure you archieve all the logs and you can then have the ability to find the errors by date.

SQS
- newly created queue structure : http://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<accountid>/<queue-name>
  for eg : http://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456123456/myqueue
- You can configure the amazon SQS message retention period to a value between 1 min to 14 days (default is 4 days). Once the message retention limit is reached, messages are automatically deleted.

Billing
- Billing reports provide information about your usage of AWS resources and estimated costs for that usage. You can have AWS generated billing reports that break down your estimated costs in different ways:
  => By the hour, day or month.
  => By each account in your organisation.
  => By product or product resource.
  => By tags that you define yourself.

CloudWatch
- You can publish your own metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API.
- Metrics are updated every five minutes and automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch for every EMR cluster. This interval is not configurable. There is no charge for the Amazon EMR metrics reported in CloudWatch. Metrics are archived for two weeks, after which the data is discarded.
- You can aggregate your data before you publish to cloudwatch. When you have multiple data points per minute, aggregating data minimizes the number of calls to put-metric-data.
  for e.g. aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name PageViewCount --namespace MyService --statistic-value Sum=11,Minimum=2,Maximum=5 etc
- The metric you configure with CloudWatch for your Amazon SNS topics are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch every 5 minutes.
- In AWS documentation it is clearly mentioned that put-metric-data command has a limit of 8KB for GET and 40KB for POST requests.
