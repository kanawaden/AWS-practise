AutoScaling
- AutoScaling will throw an error when there is conflict in the schedule of 2 seperate autoscaling process. Error is thrown during configuration of the 2nd process itself and it will not allow to save 2nd process.
- As per Autoscaling, a user can schedule an action upto a month in the future.



Load Balancer
- To ensure that a classic load balancer stops sending requests to instances that are deregistered or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connection open, use connection draining. This enables load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to the instances that are deregistered or unhealthy.

EC2
- AWS Tags enables you to categorise your AWS resources in different ways. As per AWS below are the restrictions on tags - 
    => Max no of tags per resource is 50.
    => Max key length is 127 unicode chars in UTF-8
    => Max value length is 255 unicode chars in UTF-8
    => Tags keys and values are case sensitive.
    => Do not use AWS: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use.

VPC
- Go through CIDR properly.

RDS
- In a multi AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary instance is synchronously replicated across AZ to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate IO freezes and minimizes latency spikes during system backups.
  As per AWS below are the best practices for multiAZ:
  => For production workloads, we recommend you use Provisioned IOPS and DB instance classes (m1.large and larger) that are optimized for provisioned IOPS for fast consistent performance.
  => Also if backups are scheduled during working hours, then I/O can be suspended and increase the latency of the DB, hence it is better to schedule outside office hours.

SQS
- newly created queue structure : http://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<accountid>/<queue-name>
  for eg : http://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456123456/myqueue
